Optimization of weighing factors for the Portfolio assets allocation using gradient descent

For Execution of program visit: https://deepnote.com/project/Portfolio-assets-allocation-4LJt5fEtR7ac0YcOdaMfCg/%2FNotebook%2FPortfolio%20assets%20allocation%20after%20optrimization%20of%20weights.ipynb

In this project I have considered the stocks pricing data of last 7 years for three companies Facebook, Twitter and Netflix. Lets consider a senario in which you have to 
invest $1 Million in the stock market in these three companies. From the stocks analysis we can see that Netflix has provided the highest return in the past 7 years but you can't 
invest your whole money in Netflix due to the risk involved.

The main goal of the project is to find the optimum value of weights so that one can invest money in stocks to get highest returns with lowest risk. I have considered a financial
concept called sharpe ratio that provides highest returns when maximized. The weights associated with all the stocks are optimized to maximize the sharpe ratio using gradient 
descent algorithm and making use of tensorflow. Following results have been obtained:

### Randomized portfolio worth in $ (This can be changed for different random numbers generated by program)

## Conclusion:

The randomized portfolio is performed worstly and provided nearly no return on investment and investment has fluctuated around $1 Million while the Optimized portfolio has outperformed with the lowest risk and highest resturns with return of approx. $8.6 Million.
